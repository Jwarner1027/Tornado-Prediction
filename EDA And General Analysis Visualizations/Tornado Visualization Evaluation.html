        <h1>Analysis of Tornado Data from the National Centers for Environmental Information</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This report presents an analysis of tornado data sourced from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The dataset encompasses extensive information on tornado occurrences across the United States from the 1950s to the present. However, to optimize the analysis for time and efficiency, the focus is narrowed to data from selected years within a 30-year period: 1995, 2000, 2010, 2019, and 2023.</p>
        <p>The primary goal of this project was to identify trends or changes in tornado intensity and distribution over time, assessing whether the intensity or number of tornadoes has increased in recent years.</p>

        <h2>Data Visualization and Methodology</h2>

        <h3>Map Visualization</h3>
        <p>A comprehensive map was created to visualize the distribution of tornadoes across the United States. Data points are color-coded to represent different years, aiding in the identification of temporal and spatial patterns. At a glance, the map may appear dense and overwhelming due to the volume of data points. However, when viewed from a broader perspective, it reveals the overall concentration and distribution of tornado occurrences.</p>

        <h3>Interactive Bar Chart</h3>
        <p>An interactive bar chart complements the map by displaying the counts of tornadoes at various intensity levels for each selected year. The legend is color-coded to match the map, enhancing the cohesion of the visual representation. The chart allows users to click on each category, which highlights the corresponding data points on the map, offering a clear visual connection between intensity levels and geographical distribution.</p>

        <h3>Filtering and Detailed View</h3>
        <p>To facilitate detailed analysis, interactive elements were incorporated, including dropdown menus for filtering data by year. This feature allows users to isolate and examine each year's data, providing insights into the distribution and intensity levels of tornadoes over time. By toggling between years, users can observe differences in tornado counts and locations, enabling a comparative analysis of temporal trends.</p>

        <h2>Findings</h2>

        <h3>Trends in Tornado Intensity and Distribution</h3>
        <p>Upon interacting with the visualizations, several trends and patterns emerged:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increase in Strong Tornadoes</strong>: There appears to be a noticeable increase in the number of strong tornadoes over the years.</li>
            <li><strong>Decrease in Violent Tornadoes</strong>: Conversely, the number of violent tornadoes has shown a decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Scale Adjustment</strong>: It is important to note that the scale used to determine tornado strength changed in 2007. To maintain consistency, tornado intensity levels were grouped into categories as provided by weather.gov, enabling a fair comparison across different years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User Feedback and Observations</h3>
        <p>The interactive elements were well-received during testing with friends and family. Users appreciated the ability to explore data interactively, noting that it facilitated a deeper understanding of tornado patterns. Observations included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The overall increase in strong tornadoes over the selected years.</li>
            <li>The spatial distribution of tornadoes, with noticeable clustering in certain regions.</li>
            <li>The effectiveness of interactive filters in isolating yearly data for detailed analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3>
        <p>The analysis concludes that there has been an increase in strong tornadoes over the years, while the number of violent tornadoes has decreased. The change in the scale used for measuring tornado intensity before and after 2007 was accounted for by grouping intensity levels into standardized categories.</p>
        <p>Future enhancements to this project could include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding a separate chart showing the overall total counts of tornadoes to examine proportional trends.</li>
            <li>Expanding the analysis to include more years or additional data points for a comprehensive study.</li>
            <li>Incorporating other meteorological factors to provide a more holistic understanding of tornado occurrences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, the interactive elements of the visualizations proved to be a valuable tool for data exploration, offering engaging and insightful ways to analyze tornado data.</p>
